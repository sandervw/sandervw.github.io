						<p>While many of the general education electives I took had no direct application to the field of software engineering, I feel as though 
						they still had an affect on the overall direction I took in the field, and on how I approach problems in software engineering. The most significant 
						way in which many of these courses affected my career in software engineering, was that they made me thankful for choosing SE of them. I only say 
						this half-jokingly, as many of these classes, though fun and informative, were structured strangely or did not hold my attention as well as courses 
						in my major. In this way, many of these courses affirmed my choice in software engineering as a major, something that I believe was needed during my 
						freshman and sophomore years.</p>
						<p>I would say that of the courses listed above, my favorites were the history classes. I enjoyed learning about other cultures and locations 
						in particular, and believe these have had a direct affect on my plans after college. I plan on trying to obtain a job outside of Iowa, or even 
						outside of the US after college, in no small part because these electives instilled in interest in other cultures.</p>
						<p>I would say that a common weakness of these courses is that they do not have much application when it comes to transferring problem solving 
						abilities learned to an engineering environment. This, i believe, is because many of these are not problem solving classes. They introduce new 
						cultures, ideas, values, languages, etc... but they rarely involved solving some sort of problem in a way that I was not already familiar with. 
						Many of them focused more on essays and reading assignments, things I was already quite familiar with. I do not think that this devalues these courses. 
						On the contrary, I believe that it was often good to have some of these courses as a sort of reprieve from the problem solving focus of many software 
						engineering courses. I apologize if this answer seems somewhat opposing to what was asked for in the outline, but it is how I feel. I do believe that 
						these courses were an overall benefit to my education.</p>

					<h3> - CPRE 185: 2D Game Project</h3>
					<div style="padding-left: 5px;padding-top: 5px;padding-right: 5px;padding-bottom: 5px;">
						<p>For this project, I worked on creating a 2D Game that served as our major project throughout the second half of the semester.
						This was a two person project, and was thus not expected to be very large or function-filled, but it was required that we get as much of it
						working as possible. My partner in the project dropped out of the class not long after it started, so I ended up doing the project by myself.
						The project was built entirely using C++ and a graphics library designed by the instructor for the class. It was not a large library, and 
						mostly consisted of functions for drawing simple shapes, and some functions to load .jpg image files. The class was my first programming 
						programming experience ever, and it might be one of my favorite programming experience. The instructor was very passionate about his job 
						and starting off my programming experience by building a game was tons of fun. The demo and code involved are long lost, but I still 
						Appreciate the knowledge and skills I gained in that class.</p>

					<h3> - Com S 309: 2D Game Project</h3>
					<div style="padding-left: 5px;padding-top: 5px;padding-right: 5px;padding-bottom: 5px;">
						<p>For this project, I worked on creating another 2D game project, of a similar type to my 185 project, but on a much larger scale. This 
						project was a 4 person project, composed of myself, Zackary Lovisa, Ryder Schoon, and Kim Arundale. We each worked on almost every part 
						of this project a little bit, but my main job in this was working on the multiplayer aspect of the game. We built the project using Java and 
						LwJGL, with a few other small libraries as needed. I build some TCP communication classes to start with, but ended up converting the 
						multiplayer commination system to UDP. This is easily one of the classes where I learned the most about programming, particularly with 
						multi-user communication, since I had no experience with it previously. The people I worked with in this project are also people I now work 
						with regularly in classes, and the project was a great experience for us overall. The link to the repository is below if you are interested.</p>

					<h3> - Com S 329: Mapping Application and Other Projects</h3>
					<div style="padding-left: 5px;padding-top: 5px;padding-right: 5px;padding-bottom: 5px;">
						<p>For this project, I worked on creating a mapping application to be used as a tool in concert with a tabletop RPG. This project was also 
						a 4 person project, composed of myself, Zackary Lovisa, Ryder Schoon, and Alex Rinehart. For this project I worked almost solely on the 
						mapping application, while my teammates worked on other tools. The part that I worked on was built with javascript, html, bootstrap, jquery, 
						and the google maps API. I had a lot of fun working on this project, and even though it wasn't my first experience with web design, it was 
						a good learning experience working with the google maps API. We also worked on several other projects together during that class, most of which 
						were web-apps using javascript/html and bootstrap. The link to the mapping application repository is below.</p>

					<h3>Pharmacists Mutual Company</h3>
					<div style="padding-left: 5px;padding-top: 5px;padding-right: 5px;padding-bottom: 5px;">
						<p>The main portion of my experience working with companies in the field of software engineering comes from my work with Pharmacists 
						Mutual Company, an insurance company based in Algona, Iowa. I began working for the company in May, 2016, and am currently working for 
						them. Initially I started off as an IT intern, focusing mostly on SQL based reporting services, with some work on .NET web apps as well. 
						As mentioned I currently work with them as an IT contractor, doing similar work to what I was doing as an intern. I had not worked with 
						.NET application development previously, and I had only briefly worked on database queries using SQL, so I gained experience with both of 
						those technologies while working with the company. I was not asked to create a final presentation for my internship.</p>

					<h1>Cumulative Reflection</h1>
					<div style="padding-left: 5px;padding-top: 5px;padding-right: 5px;padding-bottom: 5px;">
						<p>Over the course of my education here at Iowa State University, I have become acquainted with and worked on technologies of various 
						complexities and usefulnesses. I have enjoyed working with and learning about most of these technologies, and believe that the knowledge 
						I have gained will help me in my career as a programmer and Software Engineer. The complex technologies and classes that I gained experience 
						with will likely prove invaluable when/if I encounter them in the future.</p>
						<p>My work in groups and teams of various sizes has already aided me when working in a job environment, and made it much easier to communicate 
						with people both inside and out of my field when working in groups both large and small. While working in these groups, I was often introduced 
						to methods and programs that were not presented in class, but that proved to be useful both in the projects and outside of them. Overall, my work 
						in groups has been one of my favorite parts of my education here at Iowa State, both because of the people I worked with, and because of the new 
						and innovative technologies I was introduced to.</p>
						<p>Overall, I was very pleased with my experience here at Iowa State in the Software Engineering Program. If I were to go back through it again, 
						I might have attempted to pay more attention in the first few years of my education, but I do not think a lack of attention in my first few classes 
						ended up being hugely detrimental to my education as a whole. I also did not participate in many student organizations, career fairs, or research 
						assitanceships, which might have been interesting or helpful outside of the classroom. Quite often, however, I do apply some of what I have learned 
						at iowa state to my current job, whether it means developing code/documents, or working with other professesional in my company. In the end, 
						I believe I have been a successful student.</p>
