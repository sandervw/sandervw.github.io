					<h4>Portfolio Overview</h4>
					<div style="padding-left: 5px;padding-top: 5px;padding-right: 5px;padding-bottom: 5px;">
						<p>This portfolio contains a brief explanation into the work I have done and the things I have learned here at Iowa State University. The different sections detail 
						the things I learned in my general education courses, what I plan on doing after graduation, the work I have done in my major courses, the work I have done in 
						senior design, my internship and outside-of-class experience, my resume, and a cumulative relfection on my time here at ISU. Before coming to Iowa State, I had 
						taken a few college engineering courses in high school, and those sparked my interest in engineering, but it was the work I did at ISU and the people I met that 
						kept me in the major of Software Engineering. MY goal with this portfolio is to demonstrate the knowledge and talents, both inside and outside of my major, that I 
						have gained from my time at ISU.</p>
					</div>
					<h4>Career Objectives</h4>
					<div style="padding-left: 5px;padding-top: 5px;padding-right: 5px;padding-bottom: 5px;">
						<p>I plan on working in my field for the first few years after college at my place of work, or with a similar company in Iowa until my student loans are paid off. 
						I go into mroe detail on my Career Objectives in the General Education Reflection part of the portfolio.</p>

					<h4>General Education Reflection</h4>
					<div style="padding-left: 5px;padding-top: 5px;padding-right: 5px;padding-bottom: 5px;">
						<p>While many of the general education electives I took had no direct application to the field of software engineering, I feel as though 
						they still had an affect on the overall direction I took in the field, and on how I approach problems in software engineering. The most significant 
						way in which many of these courses affected my career in software engineering, was that they made me thankful for choosing SE of them. I only say 
						this half-jokingly, as many of these classes, though fun and informative, were structured strangely or did not hold my attention as well as courses 
						in my major. In this way, many of these courses affirmed my choice in software engineering as a major, something that I believe was needed during my 
						freshman and sophomore years. I also believe that it was often good to have some of these courses as a sort of reprieve from the problem solving focus of 
						many software engineering courses. I do believe that these courses were, in the end, an overall benefit to my education.</p>
						<p>Often while working on problems in Engineering, I will use things that I learned during my general elective courses. Software Engineering courses have a focus 
						on problem solving most of the time, but general elective courses (the ones I took anyway) tend to help more study techniques, paper-composition, and research 
						oriented learning. As an example: During one of my group project classes, S E 329, we were required to research a method of using facial recognition software, 
						design a program that recognized faces, and write up a report about it. The designing of the program was something I was familiar from software engineering, 
						and I probably could have accomplished the other two parts with only minor trouble, but the techniques I had learned for report composition and research in my 
						general education classes made it easier to finish those parts of the project in a shorter amount of time. This is just one example of how my general elective 
						courses have helped me.</p>
						<p>After college, I plan on working for a few years to pay off any remaing student loan debts. I have a bit of job security currently, as I believe that 
						the company that I am working for will offer me full time employment at graduation. I still plan on attending the upcoming career fair and perhaps going to 
						a few interviews in the event that there is an open job that really interests me. Within the next 5 to 10 years, I would like to have any remaining student 
						loan debts paid off, and I would like to be moved out of the state of Iowa. I do not dislike Iowa, but I would like to try living in a larger City in a different 
						state at soem point, if only for the experience it offers.</p>

					<h3> - CPRE 185: 2D Game Project</h3>
					<div style="padding-left: 5px;padding-top: 5px;padding-right: 5px;padding-bottom: 5px;">
						<p>For this project, I worked on creating a 2D Game that served as our major project throughout the second half of the semester.
						This was a two person project, and was thus not expected to be very large or function-filled, but it was required that we get as much of it
						working as possible. My partner in the project dropped out of the class not long after it started, so I ended up doing the project by myself.
						The project was built entirely using C++ and a graphics library designed by the instructor for the class. It was not a large library, and 
						mostly consisted of functions for drawing simple shapes, and some functions to load .jpg image files. The class was my first programming 
						programming experience ever, and it might be one of my favorite programming experience. The instructor was very passionate about his job 
						and starting off my programming experience by building a game was tons of fun. The demo and code involved are long lost, but I still 
						Appreciate the knowledge and skills I gained in that class.</p>
					</div>
					<h3> - Com S 309: 2D Game Project</h3>
					<div style="padding-left: 5px;padding-top: 5px;padding-right: 5px;padding-bottom: 5px;">
						<p>For this project, I worked on creating another 2D game project, of a similar type to my 185 project, but on a much larger scale. This 
						project was a 4 person project, composed of myself, Zackary Lovisa, Ryder Schoon, and Kim Arundale. We each worked on almost every part 
						of this project a little bit, but my main job in this was working on the multiplayer aspect of the game. We built the project using Java and 
						LwJGL, with a few other small libraries as needed. I build some TCP communication classes to start with, but ended up converting the 
						multiplayer commination system to UDP. This is easily one of the classes where I learned the most about programming, particularly with 
						multi-user communication, since I had no experience with it previously. The people I worked with in this project are also people I now work 
						with regularly in classes, and the project was a great experience for us overall. The link to the repository is below if you are interested.</p>

					<h3> - Com S 329: Mapping Application and Other Projects</h3>
					<div style="padding-left: 5px;padding-top: 5px;padding-right: 5px;padding-bottom: 5px;">
						<p>For this project, I worked on creating a mapping application to be used as a tool in concert with a tabletop RPG. This project was also 
						a 4 person project, composed of myself, Zackary Lovisa, Ryder Schoon, and Alex Rinehart. For this project I worked almost solely on the 
						mapping application, while my teammates worked on other tools. The part that I worked on was built with javascript, html, bootstrap, jquery, 
						and the google maps API. I had a lot of fun working on this project, and even though it wasn't my first experience with web design, it was 
						a good learning experience working with the google maps API. We also worked on several other projects together during that class, most of which 
						were web-apps using javascript/html and bootstrap. The link to the mapping application repository is below.</p>

					<h3>Pharmacists Mutual Company</h3>
					<div style="padding-left: 5px;padding-top: 5px;padding-right: 5px;padding-bottom: 5px;">
						<p>The main portion of my experience working with companies in the field of software engineering comes from my work with Pharmacists 
						Mutual Company, an insurance company based in Algona, Iowa. I began working for the company in May, 2016, and am currently working for 
						them. Initially I started off as an IT intern, focusing mostly on SQL based reporting services, with some work on .NET web apps as well. 
						As mentioned I currently work with them as an IT contractor, doing similar work to what I was doing as an intern. I had not worked with 
						.NET application development previously, and I had only briefly worked on database queries using SQL, so I gained experience with both of 
						those technologies while working with the company. I was not asked to create a final presentation for my internship.</p>

					<h3>Raspberry Pi Smart Home Senior Design Project</h3>
					<div style="padding-left: 5px;padding-top: 5px;padding-right: 5px;padding-bottom: 5px;">
						<p>Our project for senior design is to enhance an existing smart home system for our client, Ryan Arndorfer. He has a basic setup with Raspberry Pi Modules, but 
						wants us to design a chip/power supply layout to reduce space, and a web app to control lights and other electrical devices on the system. My role in the project is 
						lead Software Engineer. I have been working on designing the web app that will connect to a web server on the system. I have learned a few new things about security, 
						and a lot of new info on Raspberry Pi Modules, something that I did not have much experience with before. All of our documentation is on the Senior Design Website, 
						which I have linked below.</p>
						<a href="http://dec1715.sd.ece.iastate.edu/index.php">Senior Design Website (Password = "2017yesterDayCenter15%&")</a>
						<p>Though I do not think that home automation has a great many application at solving global problems, I do believe that the system our client wants to implement 
						is much simpler than other home automation solutions that currently exist, based on the research we have done. His system is cheaper, but it does not give up functionality 
						present in other systems. It does this by having most of the modules wired together with an ethernet cord, as opposed to connection via BlueTooth or wifi. This saves space 
						and money when implementing the home automation system.</p>

					<h1>Cumulative Reflection</h1>
					<div style="padding-left: 5px;padding-top: 5px;padding-right: 5px;padding-bottom: 5px;">
						<p>Over the course of my education here at Iowa State University, I have become acquainted with and worked on technologies of various 
						complexities and usefulnesses. I have enjoyed working with and learning about most of these technologies, and believe that the knowledge 
						I have gained will help me in my career as a programmer and Software Engineer. The complex technologies and classes that I gained experience 
						with will likely prove invaluable when/if I encounter them in the future. In additions, the subject of ethics has been an aspect of many
						classes I have taken in the Software Engineering classes I have taken. Though actual ethical guidelines (such as those defined by ABET or IEEE)
						have been explained in these classes, I do not feel that following ethics has been an issue I have had, before or after my time here at ISU.
						</p>
						<p>My work in groups and teams of various sizes has already aided me when working in a job environment, and made it much easier to communicate 
						with people both inside and out of my field when working in groups both large and small. While working in these groups, I was often introduced 
						to methods and programs that were not presented in class, but that proved to be useful both in the projects and outside of them. Overall, my work 
						in groups has been one of my favorite parts of my education here at Iowa State, both because of the people I worked with, and because of the new 
						and innovative technologies I was introduced to.</p>
						<p>Overall, I was very pleased with my experience here at Iowa State in the Software Engineering Program. If I were to go back through it again, 
						I might have attempted to pay more attention in the first few years of my education, but I do not think a lack of attention in my first few classes 
						ended up being hugely detrimental to my education as a whole. I also did not participate in many student organizations, career fairs, or research 
						assitanceships, which might have been interesting or helpful outside of the classroom. Quite often, however, I do apply some of what I have learned 
						at iowa state to my current job, whether it means developing code/documents, or working with other professesional in my company. In the end, 
						I believe I have been a successful student.</p>
